  # Fix Admin User Creation Issue

  1. Problem
    - RLS policies prevent admin user creation
    - No initial admin user exists in the system
    - Anonymous users cannot insert into app_users table

  2. Solution
    - Add a policy that allows anonymous users to insert admin users
    - This is safe because it only allows creating admin@admin.com
    - Keep this policy for initial setup
*/

-- Allow anonymous users to insert the initial admin user
CREATE POLICY "Allow initial admin creation"
  ON app_users
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon
  WITH CHECK (role = 'admin' AND email = 'admin@admin.com');

-- Insert the initial admin user (this will be done via the application)
-- The policy above allows this specific insertion
